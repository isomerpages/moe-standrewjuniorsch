<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>We aim for excellence in the development of an all-rounded pupil, moulded
in Christian principles, so that he becomes an upright man of grace and
polish.</p>
<h4>Spiritual Aspect</h4>
<p>ST Andrew's School(Junior) is an Anglican Church School and therefore
highlights the Message of the cross and enlightens our students on the
saving knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h4>Academic Aspect</h4>
<p>The School seeks to educate, and not merely make literate, our students
as it is important to prepare them to be good, useful and intelligent citizens.
We recognize the wide range of academic ability of our students, and we
shall tailor our curriculum in terms of width, depth and variety, to best
suit the different groups of students in our charge. The school recognizes
the importance of achieving effective bilingualism and towards this end,
we shall spare no effort to encourage and promote the learning of languages
among our students. We also seek to promote high numeracy skills among
our students.</p>
<h4>Moral and Social Values</h4>
<p>The School desires to imbue in our students moral and social values and
aspirations of our society and to practice these in their relations with
others. The School aims to have an effective moral education programme
based on God's revelation to man in Jesus Christ.</p>
<h4>Physical Education</h4>
<p>The School recognizes the importance of physical fitness and shall encourage
and maintain a high standard of aerobic and anaerobic fitness. P.E. is
taken seriously as a subject and therefore the School aims to develop skills
in at least 3 sports and/or games by the time the students leave St. Andrew's
Junior School.</p>
<h4>Curriculum Activities</h4>
<p>The school’s curriculum is designed to develop the pupils cognitively,
spiritually, social-emotionally, physically, and aesthetically, with the
view to provide all round education, and to realise the Desired Outcomes
of Education and the vision of Thinking Schools, Learning Nation. Each
child’s development in the various domains is catered through the curricular
and co-curricular programmes.</p>
<h4>(i) Curricular Programme</h4>
<p>In the delivery of the curricular programme, we continue to focus on the
development of character, thinking skills and creativity, and language
competence. The intent is to develop each pupil morally and spiritually,
social-emotionally, and cognitively and to promote friendship and teamwork.</p>
<h4>(ii) Co-curricular Programme</h4>
<p>The Co-curricular Programme augments the curricular programme in that
its activities are geared towards providing an all-round education for
the pupils and enabling them to learn continuously. It comprises Co-curricular
Activities (CCAs), learning journeys, camps, overseas tours, enrichment
programmes and additional classes. The co-curricular programmes play a
significant role in ensuring that our pupils grow up to be robust and become
men of grace.</p>
