### Principal's Message

The Bible teaches us that each tree is recognized by its own fruit.  A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. (Luke 6:44-45) Aristotle once said, “Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.”

Like our school song, St Andrew’s Junior School (SAJS) aspires to wake the heart of every boy who passes through our hands, to grow them to be servant leaders who will make lives and undertake mighty endeavours for the good of others. In SAJS, our boys will learn that education is not for one’s ambitious academic pursuit or for the benefit of oneself but to be equipped with the greater knowledge, skills and values to better serve and help others. Therefore, **Exemplary Character** forms the foundation of the SAJS educational model and we seek to develop our boys to be of exemplary character who demonstrates the St Andrew’s Village’s **TRUE** (**T**hanksgiving, **R**esilience, **U**nity, **E**mpathy) and **WISE** (**W**onder, **I**ntegrity, **S**elf-discipline, **E**xcellence) values at all times.

With the TRUE and WISE values, we hope our boys will aspire to be **Community Builders** – servant leaders who can make a positive impact to the community they live in and to the society at large. To equip them to be more effective community builders, SAJS has put in place robust programmes to develop in our boys skills to be a **Holistic Thinker** and a **Skilled Communicator**. Our **Servant Leadership Programme**was designed to provide students with authentic outdoor experiential learning experiences to develop students’ creative, analytical and reflective thinking skills and the ability to listen actively and speak confidently and clearly. It also provides the platform for our boys to apply what they have learnt to serve the community both within and beyond Singapore. In so doing, our boys will grow to see that there is a greater purpose for what they are learning in school and have the intrinsic motivation to be engaged in learning.

As the School Hymn goes: 

Our Father, by whose servants, 

Our School was built of old, 

Whose hand has crowned Thy children, 

With blessings manifold.

St Andrew’s Junior School will turn 160 years old in 2022 and I am so honoured to be part of this long and rich history of the school. I thank God for bringing together so many people, our Board of Governors, St Andrew’s Alumni, St Andrew’s Boarding House, St Andrew’s Parents-Teachers Associations, Chaplains and parents, community partners, principals, vice-principals, teachers, allied educators, counsellors, administrative staff, coaches and students, both past and present, who have painstakingly contributed and continues to shower upon many blessings to grow our boys to be servant leaders. For this, I am ever grateful.

With the completion of PERI upgrading, our Saints enjoyed these wonderful facilities – a beautiful 1.5 storey library, a new block of classrooms, outdoor fitness & PAL corner, an Indoor Sports Hall and a lift. We are thankful for those who provide and those who build. We are blessed with a conducive learning environment.

Psalm 127:1 says, “Unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labour in vain.” May we continue to look upon the Lord for His wisdom and blessings as we work together to build this school and all who passes through the gates of SAJS.

Up and On!
