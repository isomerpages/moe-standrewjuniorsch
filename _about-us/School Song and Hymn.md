<h3>The School Song</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6tn_5af4-U" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">St Andrew's School Song</a>
</p>
<p>Lives are in the making here,
<br>Hearts are in the waking here,
<br>Mighty undertaking here,
<br><strong>Up and On!</strong>
</p>
<p>We are arming for the fight,
<br>Pressing on with all our might,
<br>Pluming wings for higher flight,
<br><strong>Up and On!</strong>
</p>
<p>Up Boys! Truest fame
<br>Lies in high endeavour;
<br>Play the game! Keep the flame
<br>Burning brightly ever!</p>
<p>Fair before us lies the way,
<br>Time for work and time for play;
<br>Fill the measure while we may,
<br><strong>Up and On!</strong>
</p>
<p>Life and time will not delay,
<br>Time is running fast away,
<br>Life is now today; today;
<br><strong>Up and On!</strong>
</p>
<p>Up Boys! Truest fame
<br>Lies in high endeavour;
<br>Play the game! Keep the flame
<br>Burning brightly ever!</p>
<p>Foes in plenty we shall meet,
<br>Hearts courageous scorn defeat;
<br>So we press with eager feet,
<br><strong>Up and On!</strong>
</p>
<p>Ever onward to the fight,
<br>Ever upward to the Light,
<br>Ever true to GOD and RIGHT,
<br><strong>Up and On!</strong>
</p>
<p>Up Boys! Truest fame
<br>Lies in high endeavour;
<br>Play the game! Keep the flame
<br>Burning brightly ever!</p>
<h3>The School Hymn</h3>
<p>Our Father, by whose servants,
<br>Our School was built of old,
<br>Whose hand has crowned Thy children,
<br>With blessings manifold;</p>
<p>For Thy unfailing mercies,
<br>Far strewn along our way,
<br>With all who passed before us,
<br>We praise Thy name today.</p>
<p>They reaped not where they laboured,
<br>We reap what they have sown;
<br>Our harvest may be garnered,
<br>By ages yet unknown.</p>
<p>The days of old have dowered us
<br>With gifts beyond all praise,
<br>Our Father make us faithful
<br>To serve the coming days.</p>
<p>Before us and beside us,
<br>Still holden by Thy hand,
<br>A cloud of unseen witness,
<br>Our elder comrades stand;</p>
<p>One family unbroken,
<br>We join with one acclaim;
<br>One heart, one voice uplifting
<br>To glorify Thy name.</p>
