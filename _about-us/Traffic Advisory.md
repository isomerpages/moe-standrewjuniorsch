<h3>Getting to ST Andrew's School (Junior) Safely</h3>
<p>Student safety is a priority of our School. The safety of students using
roads leading to and from the school is the responsibility of all. We need
motorists to play their part by slowing down as they approach the vicinity
of the school, and parents to reinforce the importance of road safety at
home.</p>
<p>During peak traffic periods such as morning arrival time, students arriving
to school by car are to alight at the Drop-Off Zone. Please cooperate with
our staff and security guards who are deployed to facilitate the flow of
traffic and reinforce road safety behaviour.</p>
<h3>Walking to School via Diocese Gate (6:30am - 7:30am)</h3>
<p>Do allow your son to walk to School by himself <u>at the top of the stairs and after the Diocese Building</u> (as
shown on the map and picture below). Please refrain from accompanying your
son along Francis Thomas Drive to exit at Potong Pasir Ave 3.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT – Parents who wish to visit our General Office</strong>
<br>Parents who wish to visit our General Office are required to register
at our Guard Post along Potong Pasir Ave 3. A security sticker will be
issued upon registration. We seek your understanding as the registration
process is necessary to ensure security and safety of our students and
staff.</p>
