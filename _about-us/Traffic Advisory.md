### Getting to St. Andrew’s Junior School Safely
 


Student safety is a priority of our School. The safety of students using roads leading to and from the school is the responsibility of all. We need motorists to play their part by slowing down as they approach the vicinity of the school, and parents to reinforce the importance of road safety at home.

During peak traffic periods such as morning arrival time, students arriving to school by car are to alight at the Drop-Off Zone. Please cooperate with our staff and security guards who are deployed to facilitate the flow of traffic and reinforce road safety behaviour.

to School via Diocese Gate

Do allow your son to walk to School by himself at the top of the stairs and after the Diocese Building (as shown on the map and picture below). Please refrain from accompanying your son along Francis Thomas Drive to exit at Potong Pasir Ave 3.

IMPORTANT – Parents who wish to visit our General Office
Parents who wish to visit our General Office are required to register at our Guard Post along Potong Pasir Ave 3. A security sticker will be issued upon registration. We seek your understanding as the registration process is necessary to ensure security and safety of our students and staff.
