<h3>Visual Art Club</h3>
<p>The Visual Art Club (VAC) aims to explore new perspectives, the life of
our imagination with its intense feelings, and that which guides our Saintsâ€™
intentions and actions in the world.</p>
<p>The key values at the heart of the VAC: Commitment, teamwork, and creativity.</p>
<p>Saints are encouraged to be creative in designing and conceptualising
their artistic creations and then to work together as a team to achieve
their visions.</p>
<p>They are presented with opportunities to appreciate art in all its forms,
and they learn how art can empower us to aim high and to bring beauty and
fresh vision to our world.</p>
