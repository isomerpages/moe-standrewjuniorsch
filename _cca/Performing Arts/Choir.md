### Choir



In the Performing Arts CCA, pupils are given the opportunities to develop their talents in singing and acting. We alternate between preparing the boys for the National choir competition (SYF) in one year and putting up a Musical on alternate years that is professionally written, directed, and choreographed. Through the training sessions provided by the CCA, the boys learn values such as teamwork, commitment, responsibility, and a sense of robustness. They will also acquire skills such as voice projection, self-awareness, good posture, and correct singing and speaking techniques, all trained by professional instructors.

The Choir, also known as The Singing Saints, have performed for varied audiences within and outside school. In the previous SYF in 2008 and 2010, we obtained a Gold (with Honours) Award. The only boys’ choir in Singapore to attain this achievement.

We have also been on overseas trips to Sydney (1997), Brisbane (2004) and Japan (2006, 2010). In 2008, we took part in an international choral competition in the Czech Republic and obtained a Silver award for the Boys’ choir and a Gold award for the combined children’s choir.

One of the exciting events will be the original Musicals we put up on alternate years. We staged our 8th Production in 2011, entitled “Ah Ter and the Blue Dragon”. Preparation for the musical productions will always be memorable experiences for the boys that will help build lasting friendships among them.
