<h3>Hockey</h3>
<p>The SAS(J) Hockey CCA aspires to reach out to each and every Saint who
has a profound interest in hockey and in need for an opportunity to develop
and shine their talents. It is a platform for hockey students to display
their enthusiasm in the sport as well as to pick up commendable habits
like teamwork and commitment which can be applied in their everyday lives.
It's well planned and spaced-out practices aim to inculcate the importance
of discipline whereby students understand the importance of juggling well
between their daily academic curriculum and their hockey trainings and
tournaments. Students are also trained to carry out personal reflection
to acquire a greater understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>In 2011, our junior boys clinched the National Championship whereas our
senior boys came in 1st runners up. We hope to build on our achievements
and even propel our boys to reach greater heights.</p>
<p>Up and On!</p>
