<h3>Rugby</h3>
<p>Saints' rugby has had a long and memorable history and since junior rugby
kicked off in 1996, we have won 8 out of 10 South Zone titles and 7 out
of a possible 10 National titles. Over the years, we have grown from just
1 competition squad of U12's to a massive 6 competition teams and 6 development
squads (U8, U9, U10, U11, U13).</p>
<p>We started off with a self-run tournament in 2000 organised by St. Andrew's
Parents Teachers Association (SAPTA), where we invited the top 16 primary
schools to participate in our very own SAPTA Challenge Cup. We had a total
of about 50 boys in our CCA then.</p>
<p>The opening of additional competition squads and development teams was
introduced in 2003, where we started to participate in Centaurs RFC, invitational
rugby festivals and tournaments. Since then, we are proud to say that we
are one of the most developed rugby playing junior schools in Singapore,
currently mentoring about 160 boys in our CCA.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy looking through our past achievements and our snapshots
of some great memories that have made Saints rugby what it is today.</p>
