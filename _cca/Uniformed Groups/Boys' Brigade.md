<h3>Boys' Brigade</h3>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>To nurture in each boy the habits of obedience, reverence, discipline,
self-respect, and all that will lead towards a true Christian Manliness.</p>
<h4>Programme</h4>
<p>The 7th Junior Company runs a weekly program on Friday morning together
with the help of the sponsoring church, Church of the Ascension, where
the boys are nurtured, based on Christian values, to serve and to lead.
Each boy in his respective level goes through a yearly badge workbook.
The badge workbook covers four aspects, mainly spiritual, physical, enrichment
and social.</p>
<p>Spiritual: The boys learn more about Jesus and ways to relate to God.</p>
<p>Physical: Through camps and drills, the boys develop self-discipline,
resilience, and unity.</p>
<p>Enrichment: The boys pick up life skills in different areas.</p>
<p>Social: The boys learn how to exhibit empathy to the less privileged and
serve the school community.</p>
<p>At P6, every boy will go through a competition (Adventure Quest) in order
to obtain their-his final badge, the Gold badge. This exclusive badge is
the only badge he can wear if he chooses to pursue BB when he enters secondary
school.</p>
<p>Every year, all the boys (P3 to P6) will go through a selection test for
the annual Character Quest. This competition emphasizes the character traits
of the different bible characters that the boys can learn from.</p>
<p>Besides these competitions, there are other events such as BB Cares where
boys are involved in serving the community, and the BB Share-a-Gift event
where boys are encouraged to donate food items for the less fortunate.
An annual camp is also held to strengthen all these traits taught. This
helps to reinforce the lessons taught in badge work.</p>
<h3>Parents can help in the following areas</h3>
<p>(A) Annual Camp - Guide and encourage the boys through their hikes and
activities as they learn values such as resilience and unity.</p>
<p>(B) Weekly Parades - Teach the boys values through bible stories, discipline
through drills, or striving for excellence through games. Volunteer to
teach them certain skills. Do contact us for volunteering opportunities.</p>
