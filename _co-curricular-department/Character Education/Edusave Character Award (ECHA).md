<h3><strong><u>Edusave Character Award (ECHA)</u></strong></h3>
<p>MOE introduced the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) in 2012 to enable schools
to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding
personal qualities. The award also supports our school’s continuing efforts
in nurturing students of good values and character, who are active contributors
and concerned citizens.</p>
<h4><u>Objectives</u></h4>
<p>The objectives of the ECHA are:</p>
<p>• To send a clear and strong signal of the importance that MOE places
on character and values, on par with achievements in the academic domain;
and</p>
<p>• To recognise outstanding students in each school who are exemplary in
character, and who can be role models to inspire others.</p>
<h4><u>Eligibility Criteria</u></h4>
<p>1) Student must be a Singapore citizen.</p>
<p>2) Students must, on a consistent basis, demonstrate good character and
values. In particular, students may be identified for demonstrating the
following:</p>
<p>o Qualities associated with any of the school’s TRUEWISE values, and/or</p>
<p>o A high level of civic responsibility: Students show concern for issues
relating to their community or issues faced by others. They play an active
role to address these issues and demonstrate commitment to making a difference;
and/or</p>
<p>o Qualities associated with resilience: Students who persevere despite
facing difficult circumstances (e.g. financial problems, health issues,
family issues, peer resistance etc.) and manage to overcome the odds and
still do commendably well in academic and non-academic domains.</p>
<p>o Students may be nominated regardless of their academic results provided
that their weak academic results are not due to negative character traits
but are attributed to difficulties that go beyond the control of the student.</p>
