<h4>Committee Vision</h4>
<p>To equip each Saint with the skills, competencies, values, and attitudes
to become a Servant Leader</p>
<hr>
<h4>Programmes</h4>
<h5>(i) Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</h5>
<p>The FTGP provides teachers with a platform for the explicit teaching of
Social-Emotional Learning values and allows for teachers to interact with
students through meaningful and enriching activities to further Teacher-Student
Relationship. This time is also used for the one-to-one interviews of the
students that are conducted by either the Form or Co-Form teachers of the
class. FTGP is conducted once a week.</p>
<h5>(ii) Zero Period</h5>
<p>Zero period is a 30 minutes lesson conducted at the beginning of the day
for 2 days a week.</p>
<p>The lessons help to develop social emotional competencies in pupils. It
also helps to improve teacher-pupil relationship as well as create a greater
bonding amongst peers. By building quality relationship, we hope to make
schooling a pleasant experience for our children so that they look forward
to coming to school. A wide variety of activities are carried out during
these lessons. Some of which include breakfast sessions, games, goal setting
activities, time management tips, reflection writing etc.</p>
<h5>(iii) Values-in-Action</h5>
<p>The aim of Values-in-Action is to instill in our pupils a love for the
community they are immediately immersed in, e.g., the school, and the wider
St Andrew’s community. As they mature, we aim to make each Saint aware
of the Singaporean community as they undertake more outreach programmes
to the less fortunate among Singapore society. Values-in-Education is the
`practical action’ component of our Character Development Programme. Even
as the children learn about school values and other moral values, they
need to practice these, and develop life-long attitudes towards service
and care for others.</p>
<h5>(iv) Sexuality Education</h5>
<p>The school uses the Growing Years package as recommended by MOE. Only
teachers trained in the package are deployed to teach the lessons. Lessons
are taught during curriculum hours and are delivered through a modular
programme.</p>

<h4>Parents can help us in the following areas</h4>
<h5>(i) Be our partners</h5>
<p>Be our partners in education by reinforcing the values and attitudes that
are taught in school. Please ensure that your son wears the prescribed
school uniform as stipulated in the school Personal Organizer. Instill
the importance of punctuality by ensuring that your son reports to school
punctually. Help him plan a study timetable so that he is able to manage
his time effectively to complete to his homework and to revise his work
to consolidate learning. Do monitor your son’s work closely to show that
you are working in collaboration with the school to help him reach his
potential.</p>
