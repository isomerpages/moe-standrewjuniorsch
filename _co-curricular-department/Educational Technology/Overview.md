<h5>(ii) Eye rest and well-being</h5>
<p>Parents can actively contribute to their child's eye health and overall
well-being by reminding them to take regular breaks and rest their eyes
after prolonged computer use. It is crucial to establish clear expectations
and agree upon a reasonable duration of screen time allowed each day. Furthermore,
creating a well-lit environment for computer usage can significantly reduce
eye strain. By implementing these measures, you can help your child avoid
both eye fatigue and repetitive strain injuries, while also promoting a
healthy balance between screen time and other activities.</p>
