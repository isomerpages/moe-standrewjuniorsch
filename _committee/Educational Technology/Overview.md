_Enhance personalisation of students’ learning experience_

Students access digital resources and the AI-enabled [Student Learning Space (SLS)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/student-learning-space) and harness their potential for personalised learning experiences.

_Connect students in collaborative networks_

Students collaborate in digital making and engage in creative endeavours, including coding, programming robots, composing music, producing visual art, and delving into 3D printing techniques.

##### (ii) Eye rest and well-being

Parents can actively contribute to their child's eye health and overall well-being by reminding them to take regular breaks and rest their eyes after prolonged computer use. It is crucial to establish clear expectations and agree upon a reasonable duration of screen time allowed each day. Furthermore, creating a well-lit environment for computer usage can significantly reduce eye strain. By implementing these measures, you can help your child avoid both eye fatigue and repetitive strain injuries, while also promoting a healthy balance between screen time and other activities.
