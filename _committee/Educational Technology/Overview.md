#### Programmes

##### (i) ICT Skills Training

The department develops her programmes based on MOE ICT baseline standards and beyond.

Pupils from all levels are exposed to IT lessons on top of integrated ICT lessons within the curriculum. The lessons take place on a weekly basis and apart from learning the skills, boys are tasked with a mini-project at the end of the course where they will be graded based on assessment rubrics. We learned that these mini-projects are extremely important to our boys' socio-intellectual development because it is in itself an authentic situation and promotes problem-solving skills and intellectual character.

The scope and depth of the IT lessons are catered specifically to the child's developmental age.

At SAJS, ICT Baseline Standards and Cyber Wellness topics are intregated into our curriculum and topics, click here to learn about our ICT Enrichment Programme:

Other than Infocomm training programmes, the Media Club also challenges the young minds on projects, as well as nation-wide and international IT competitions.
