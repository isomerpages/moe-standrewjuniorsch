#### Parents can help us in the following areas

##### (i) Be our partners

Be our partners in education by reinforcing the values and attitudes that are taught in school.

Please remind your son to wear the prescribed school uniform as stipulated in the school Personal Organizer and go through the school rules with him.

Instill the importance of punctuality by ensuring that your son reports to school punctually and be with their class for morning assembly when the school bell rings.

Teach him the importance of self-discipline in all that he sets out to do and to demonstrate exemplary character at all times.

#### School Homework Policy

The purpose of homework is to support the teaching in class and provide opportunities for pupils to apply the knowledge and skills learnt in the classroom. It will enable pupils to realise their responsibility for independent learning and strengthen their good study habits and skills.

Homework should also serve as a form of formative assessment to provide valuable feedback for learning. [Click here to learn more about the School Homework Policy](/files/homeworkpolicy.pdf).
