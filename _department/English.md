<h4>Department Vision</h4>
<p>Every Saint, an active listener, eloquent speaker, critical reader and
skilled writer</p>
<hr>
<h4>Department Mission</h4>
<p>To inspire the love for language through rich learning environments, creative
activities and positive role models</p>
<hr>
<h4>Programmes</h4>
<p>A strong command of the English Language allows Saints to think about
ideas with clarity and precision. In particular, we seek to develop Holistic
Thinkers who are creative, analytical and reflective.</p>
<p>In our department, we believe that proficiency of the English Language
is cultivated through rich learning experiences. Our programmes encourage
the daily use of the English Language through reading, listening, speaking
and writing.</p>
<p>Language also empowers us to understand our emotions and develop skills
to communicate with others effectively. The ability to express our feelings
both through spoken and written means is especially important in this digital
age. With technology allowing communication to transcend physical boundaries,
Saints should be able not only to express themselves effectively online,
but also be able to listen and read critically to understand others. These
are the traits of the Skillful Communicator.</p>
<p>Apart from using language as a means to think, feel, and communicate,
the deep appreciation for the beauty of a language can be a valuable end
in itself. At times, the development of such an appreciation involves playing
with the language rather than direct instruction. By playing with the language,
Saints can better understand how language functions in different contexts.
To this end, our Saints will be provided with sufficient opportunities
to appreciate word play, poems, drama and song lyrics.</p>
<p>Using Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle, our language teachers deliver
lessons where the learner gets himself involved in doing, reflecting, concluding
and applying what he has learnt. The department believes that this approach
to teaching language will ensure higher levels of pupil engagement and
practical opportunities to apply their learning.</p>
<h5>(i) Drop Everything and Read (DEAR)</h5>
<p>On Mondays to Wednesdays, P1 to P6 pupils are required to read an English
storybook from the time they arrive at their classrooms to 7.20am. He can
read any book of his choice during this time. At appropriate junctures,
the class EL Captain will invite various pupils to share a book review.
This provides them an opportunity to practise public speaking and learn
from other pupils’ reading experiences.</p>
<p>Through this programme, we hope to cultivate a routine of self-directed
and independent reading.</p>
<h5>(ii) IRead Book</h5>
<p>P1 and P2 pupils are encouraged to develop the love for reading. Each
class will be issued books for pupils to borrow. Pupils will read one book
a day and exchange the book with another pupil the next day.</p>
<p>Parents’ involvement in their children’s learning is crucial. Thus, we
strongly encourage our pupils to read the book to, or with, their parents
at home. A short sharing about the book is also done in class.</p>
<h5>(iii) Speech and Drama</h5>
<p>P1 and P2 pupils will experience learning oracy through speech and drama
lessons that are incorporated into the school’s EL curriculum. We hope
to inculcate the confidence and clarity in communication through the use
of skills from the performing arts. This is aligned to our school’s key
emphasis on developing Skilled Communicators.</p>
<h5>(iv) Reader’s Theatre</h5>
<p>In our attempt to promote creativity, self-confidence and critical thinking,
we hope to expose our middle primary pupils to story-telling using drama
conventions. These activities are also infused within the EL curriculum
where students will learn how to express themselves with confidence and
clarity.</p>
<h5>(v) Morning Oracy Progamme</h5>
<p>Selected P6 pupils undergo this specially designed program to prepare
them for the PSLE Oral Examinations. Parent Volunteers (PVs) work together
with SAJS EL teachers to provide additional support to prepare our boys
for their oral examinations.</p>
<p>All PVs in this programme participate in a training session with a representative
from the EL department, who leads the programme. Their active participation
is key to the success of this programme and SAJS is especially grateful
to them for supporting our boys’ learning.</p>
<h5>(vi) Hearts and Voices</h5>
<p>Hearts and Voices is a Key Signature Programme where pupils are provided
with learning experiences and taught core writing strategies to improve
their writing skills.</p>
<p>Teachers make use of Making Thinking Visible strategies and routines such
as the Ladder of Feedback and Claim-Support-Question to enhance our pupils’
thinking and level of creativity.</p>
<p>In every writing cycle, students will complete these bite-sized activities
as a build-up to their actual writing piece. Along the way, students work
together and brainstorm for ideas, good vocabulary and plan their stories
through these activities.</p>
