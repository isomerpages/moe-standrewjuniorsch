<h4>Department Vision</h4>
<p>Each Saint is a self-directed problem-solver.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Department Aims</h4>
<p>We hope to develop the following learning dispositions in our Saints:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To persevere in problem-solving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To forge connections and apply learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide logical reasoning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To think about one's own thinking</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From Primary One to Primary Four, emphasis is placed on understanding
concepts and acquiring skills. While the pupils are learning the skills,
they need to focus on the processes which include the ability to reason,
communicate (explain solutions) and make connections.</p>
<p>When the pupils proceed to Primary Five and Primary Six, the ability to
problem-solve becomes the key. A successful and effective problem-solver
will be able to apply the mathematical concepts and skills learnt in different
situations including non-routine ones and real-world problems. In order
to do this, other than focusing on understanding concepts, acquiring skills,
explaining processes, they need to be able to monitor their own Mathematical
learning and have a positive attitude towards the subject.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>We have a structured curriculum across six levels focusing on developing
and deepening understanding of concepts and acquisition of skills. Our
boys are engaged cognitively in lessons with the use of math manipulatives,
ICT tool, thinking routines, and problem-based performance tasks. Different
heuristics skills are incorporated into the curriculum and hands-on activities
are carried out during lessons to deepen understanding and learning. Some
of our favourite thinking routines are Claim-Connect-Confirm, What makes
you say that, I used to think…Now I think, See-Think-Wonder and Connect-Extend-Challenge.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Programmes</h4>
<p>In our continuous pursuit for excellence. Mathematics has been integrated
in different platforms such as the Charity Pushcart Programme, Learning
Journeys for our Primary One and Two students, P5 Math trail (in collaboration
with St. Andrew's Secondary School) as well as P6 Entrepreneurship Day.
A yearly activity where pupils work in groups to plan, market, price, promote
and implement their projects to raise funds for the needy.</p>

<h4>Parents can help in the following areas</h4>
<h5>(i) Be encouraging</h5>
<p>Acknowledge your child's effort beyond his achievements so that he will
be encouraged to work on Mathematics and develop a passion and interest
for the subject.</p>
<h5>(ii) Help your child to focus on the process of learning and to strategize his effort</h5>
<p>Take time with your child to look at the working and not just the final
answer of a sum. It is possible that there are a&nbsp;variety of methods&nbsp;that
can be used to solve a problem. Identify common key words and vocabulary
which would help the child restate the problem.</p>
<h5>(iii) Check for reasonableness of answers</h5>
<p>Make a conscious effort to train your child to check his work especially
if he has time left. Gently remind him to check for ‘appropriateness of
answers. E.g., An eraser cannot possibly cost $120!</p>
