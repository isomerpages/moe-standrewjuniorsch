#### Department Vision

Each Saint is a self-directed problem-solver.

* * *

#### Department Aims

We hope to develop the following learning dispositions in our Saints:

*   To persevere in problem-solving
*   To forge connections and apply learning
*   To provide logical reasoning
*   To think about one's own thinking

From Primary One to Primary Four, emphasis is placed on understanding concepts and acquiring skills. While the pupils are learning the skills, they need to focus on the processes which include the ability to reason, communicate (explain solutions) and make connections.

When the pupils proceed to Primary Five and Primary Six, the ability to problem-solve becomes the key. A successful and effective problem-solver will be able to apply the mathematical concepts and skills learnt in different situations including non-routine ones and real-world problems. In order to do this, other than focusing on understanding concepts, acquiring skills, explaining processes, they need to be able to monitor their own Mathematical learning and have a positive attitude towards the subject.

#### Approach

We have a structured curriculum across six levels focusing on developing and deepening understanding of concepts and acquisition of skills. Our boys are engaged cognitively in lessons with the use of math manipulatives, ICT tool, thinking routines, and problem-based performance tasks. Different heuristics skills are incorporated into the curriculum and hands-on activities are carried out during lessons to deepen understanding and learning. Some of our favourite thinking routines are Claim-Connect-Confirm, What makes you say that, I used to think…Now I think, See-Think-Wonder and Connect-Extend-Challenge.

#### Programmes

In our continuous pursuit for excellence. Mathematics has been integrated in different platforms such as the Charity Pushcart Programme, Learning Journeys for our Primary One and Two students, P5 Math trail (in collaboration with St. Andrew's Secondary School) as well as P6 Entrepreneurship Day. A yearly activity where pupils work in groups to plan, market, price, promote and implement their projects to raise funds for the needy.

#### Parents can help in the following areas

##### (i) Be encouraging

Acknowledge your child's effort beyond his achievements so that he will be encouraged to work on Mathematics and develop a passion and interest for the subject.

##### (ii) Help your child to focus on the process of learning and to strategize his effort

Take time with your child to look at the working and not just the final answer of a sum. It is possible that there are a&nbsp;variety of methods&nbsp;that can be used to solve a problem. Identify common key words and vocabulary which would help the child restate the problem.

##### (iii) Check for reasonableness of answers

Make a conscious effort to train your child to check his work especially if he has time left. Gently remind him to check for ‘appropriateness of answers. E.g., An eraser cannot possibly cost $120!
