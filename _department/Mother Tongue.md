<h4>Programmes</h4>
<h5>(i) 2-2-2 model</h5>
<p>The Mother Tongue department works in a 2-2-2 model, and focuses on specific
areas of development at each phase.</p>
<h5>Phase 1</h5>
<p>Primary 1- Primary 2: The Candy floss Program</p>
<p>As reflected by its name, the candy floss program carries the characteristics
very much like the candy floss itself, sweet, attractive, and soft. Through
the incorporation of stories, songs and games into the curriculum, we focus
on “winning the hearts” of the little ones, making the learning of Mother
Tongue interesting and attractive.</p>
<h5>Phase 2</h5>
<p>Primary 3- Primary 4: The Vineyard Program</p>
<p>The aim of the Vineyard program are to cultivate good learning attitudes
and habits. At this phase, teachers will emphasize on the building of reading,
writing and information seeking skills to prepare a “fertile and rich”
soil for further development of more complex linguistic skills in the next
phase.</p>
<h5>Phase 3</h5>
<p>Primary 5- Primary 6: The Guinness Record Program</p>
<p>At Primary 5 and Primary 6 levels, teachers will focus on enhancing all
linguistic skills taught in the first four years of primary education as
well as examination techniques, to encourage pupils to break their own
records and excel in their final stage of learning in the primary school.</p>
