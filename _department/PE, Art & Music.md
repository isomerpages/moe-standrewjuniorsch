<h4>Programmes</h4>
<p>The PE, Art &amp; Music Department seeks to develop in all saints a love
and appreciation of sports, physical exercise, art, and music to lead a
well-balanced lifestyle.</p>
<h5>(i) PHE Syllabus</h5>
<p>P1 to P4 pupils learn skills in the domains of Athletics, Dance, Games
&amp; Sports, Gymnastics, Physical Health Education (PHE), and Outdoor
Education.</p>
<h5>(ii) Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</h5>
<p>P1 to P2 pupils participate in a whole year programme exploring, experiencing,
and expressing themselves in the domains of Outdoor Education, Performance
Arts, Sports &amp; Games and Visual Arts.</p>
<h5>(iii) Saints Games Day</h5>
<p>P1 to P6 pupils showcase skills learnt from PHE Syllabus in a sporting
event designed to achieve team excellence.</p>
<h5>(iv) P3 SwimSafer Programme / P3 Swimming Carnival</h5>
<p>P3 pupils participate in a learn-to-swim programme ending with a swimming
carnival to showcase the skills they have learnt.</p>
<h5>(v) Art</h5>
<p>The Art curriculum seeks to cultivate a spirit of innovation and creativity
by encouraging pupils to share their ideas, thoughts and feelings through
their art work with the aim of developing self-confidence and celebrating
achievements. &nbsp;In the process, pupils also develop appreciation for
the visual art and become visually literate in their ability to observe,
understand, and make meaning of what they see. Through in house and external
art competitions, pupils are given the opportunity to express themselves
and find their voice through the art making process.</p>
<h5>(vi) Music</h5>
<p>Through the teaching and learning of basic theory, music appreciation
and music making, pupils learn to express themselves musically. All pupils
are able to play the recorder and the guitar with some proficiency by the
time they reach the Primary Six level. We hope to inspire in all our saints
a love for music.</p>
