#### Programmes

The PE, Art & Music Department seeks to develop in all saints a love and appreciation of sports, physical exercise, art and music to lead a well-balanced lifestyle.

##### (i) PHE Syllabus

P1 to P4 pupils learn skills in the domains of Athletics, Dance, Games & Sports, Gymnastics, Physical Health Education and Outdoor Education.

##### (ii) Programme for Active Learning (PAL)

P1 to P2 pupils participate in a whole year programme exploring, experiencing and expressing themselves in the domains of Outdoor Education, Performance Arts, Sports & Games and Visual Arts.

##### (iii) Saints Games Day

P1 to P6 pupils showcase skills learnt from PHE Syllabus in a sporting event designed to achieve team excellence.

##### (iv) P3 SwimSafer Programme / P3 Swimming Carnival

P3 pupils participate in a learn-to-swim programme ending with a swimming carnival to showcase the skills they have learnt.

##### (v) Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)

P3 to P6 pupils participate in CCA to develop their talent and interest, showcase character and contribute their efforts to achieve team goals.

##### (vi) Art

The new Art curriculum seeks to cultivate a spirit of innovation and experimentation and teaches pupils to share their ideas, thoughts and feelings through their art work with the aim of developing self-confidence and celebrating achievements.  In the process, pupils also develop appreciation for the visual art and become visually literate in their ability to observe, understand and make meaning of what they see. Through in house and external art competitions, pupils are given the opportunity to express themselves and feel excited about the art making process with the assistance of skilled external art vendors in partnership with our own art teachers.

##### (vii) Music

For music, the focus is on the teaching and learning of basic theory, music appreciation and music making.  All pupils are able to play the recorder and the guitar with some proficiency by the time they reach the Primary Six level.  This is the kind of confidence we instill in our boys - the ability to express themselves musically through one or more forms of expressions.
