<h4>Parents can help in the following areas</h4>
<h5>(i) Encourage curiosity by asking questions</h5>
<p>Parents can engage your child through asking questions to stimulate his
thinking. Allow him to explore different forms of answers and to come up
with his own questions.</p>
<h5>(ii) Monitoring</h5>
<p>Parents can also help by ensuring your son files his worksheets properly.
You may also encourage him to plan and adhere to a study schedule for revision
of Science to consolidate his learning.</p>
