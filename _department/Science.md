**(i) 5Es Instructional Model**

The department leverages the 5Es instructional model of Engage, Explore, Explain, Explore and Evaluate in Science lessons to make learning authentic, relevant, and exciting for our boys.

**(ii) Hands-on Activities**

The department uses hands-on activities to help pupils deepen their knowledge of the various concepts learnt in class. Lively classroom discussions and use of educational videos also help to promote scientific thinking.

#### Parents can help in the following areas

##### (i) Encourage curiosity by asking questions

Parents can engage your child through asking questions to stimulate his thinking. Allow him to explore different forms of answers and to come up with his own questions.

##### (ii) Monitoring

Parents can also help by ensuring your son files his worksheets properly. You may also encourage him to plan and adhere to a study schedule for revision of Science to consolidate his learning.
