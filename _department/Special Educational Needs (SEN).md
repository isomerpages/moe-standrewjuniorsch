<h1>Overview</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Special Educational Needs (SEN) Department seeks to nurture, develop
and support students with learning needs by working together with the teachers,
parents and/or psychologist/therapist(s).</p>
<p>Special Educational Needs Officers (SENOs) collaborate with teachers to
support students with learning differences, providing assistance both within
the classroom and through pull-out sessions tailored to their learning
and social needs. Their goal is to help students enhance their skills,
enabling them to engage with the curriculum effectively and foster meaningful
interactions and friendships with peers. SENOs also focus on building strong
relationships with students to boost their self-confidence, self-esteem,
and independence, preparing them for life’s challenges.</p>
<p>Teachers Trained in Special Needs (TSN-trained teachers) provide learning
support and plan instructional strategies and adapt lessons for students
with special educational needs and share strategies with other teachers
in school.</p>
