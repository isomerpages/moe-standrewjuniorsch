<h3>Application for Leave of Absence</h3>
<p>In support of Singapore’s regionalisation efforts, the school has adopted
a Leave of Absence Scheme (LOA) to facilitate children who accompany their
parents on overseas posting to be readmitted upon their return.</p>
<p>Under this scheme, children granted LOA will continue to be registered
as a student of the school. Upon their return, they can be readmitted directly.</p>
<h4>Eligibility</h4>
<p>The child must be a&nbsp;<strong>Singapore citizen (SC)</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR)</strong>&nbsp;,
and</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>is presently studying in our school and will be accompanying his parent
on an overseas posting and intends to rejoin us on his return,&nbsp;<strong>or</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have registered for Primary One but will be overseas at the start of the
school year</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>LOA Services</h4>
<p>We will provide the following services to our LOA students to ensure that
they remain engaged with our school and to ease their subsequent return
to the school:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Administrative matters</strong>&nbsp;— We will inform LOA students
of key notices that impact them, e.g. P1 sibling registration, DSA exercises,
registration for key national examinations, LOA renewal and returning arrangements,
etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Academic Matters</strong>&nbsp;— Upon request, the school will
send assessment/past year exam papers to parents/guardians via email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relationship Matters</strong>&nbsp;— We will keep LOA students
informed of developments in the school and the local education scene.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>LOA Fees and Renewal of LOA</h4>
<p>We charge an annual nominal fee for a child on Leave of Absence. At the
end of each year, parents will need to decide whether to renew the LOA
for their child for another year. LOA status will lapse for those who decide
not to renew their LOA application.</p>
