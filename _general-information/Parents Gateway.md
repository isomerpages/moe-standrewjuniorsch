### Parents Gateway

Parents Gateway is an initiative by MOE to enable parents to interact with schools more conveniently on administrative matters. Parents will also be able to use this app to stay updated on school’s programme and activities.  
  
We appreciate if you can share with us your feedback to help MOE enhance and improve the experience, benefiting more parents in future.  
  

The free app will bring several benefits, including: 

*   Providing parents with timely information about school events 
*   One platform to view your child / children without logging out, even if your children are from different schools
*   Enabling parents to perform a range of functions including giving consent for school trips 
*   Reducing usage of paper and decreasing environmental impact
*   Convenient way to declare travel plans
*   Convenient way to update your contact information
*   Update particulars ([guide](/files/Update%20your%20contact%20details%20in%20Parents%20Gateway.pdf))
*   Declare travel plans ([guide](/files/Parents%20Guide%20for%20PG%20Travel%20Declaration.pdf))

We strongly encourage all parents to download and use the Parents Gateway App as it will bring significant benefits for parents, teachers and the school.
