Junior Saints Mum (JSM) was a spin off from SAPTA since 2018 by passionate and like-minded mums who inspire to support the mothers' learning journey during their son's primary school years in SAJS.

JSM has 3 key purposes, the 3Es that is to Empower, Engage, Encourage. Within the short span of two years, the club has recruited about 200 mothers. Regular monthly talks were held on the last Thursday of each month from 8am - 9am for Saints mums. Every month, about 50 mothers were engaged through parenting talks relating to hot topics like communication, bonding, bullying, motivation, overcoming anxiety, strategies for Math and Science followed by refreshments and networking.
