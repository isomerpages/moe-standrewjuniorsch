The St. Andrew’s Parent-Teacher Association (SAPTA) was founded several decades ago with well-meaning parents coming together to support the school by getting involved with its activities. The association was officially registered in 1970 as a voluntary&nbsp;organisation&nbsp;that works to support the well-being of parents, teachers, and students.  

The SAPTA logo integrates the letter “A” with three triangles at the end of the masthead representing&nbsp;PARENTS,&nbsp;TEACHERS&nbsp;and&nbsp;STUDENTS, our&nbsp;main focus. In supporting the school, SAPTA members come together to provide for the needs of all our parents, teachers, and boys. Areas where we focus our efforts are:

STUDENTS

*   Sponsoring of Exam Fees  
    
*   Providing Scholarships&nbsp;for&nbsp;deserving students, recognizing both Academic and Sports Excellence  
    
*   Started&nbsp;the SAPTA&nbsp;Tuition Program for Sports Boys and funding it since 2008  
    
*   Sponsoring&nbsp;inter-class&nbsp;events to promote creativity and encourage positive&nbsp;competition among students  
    

TEACHERS

*   Co-sponsoring&nbsp;Teachers'&nbsp;Retreats and&nbsp;Teacher's Day&nbsp;Celebrations  
    
*   Organizing Teachers'&nbsp;Out-Reach&nbsp;Programmes  
    
*   Organizing Parent-Teacher&nbsp;Sports and Recreational Events

*   Organising&nbsp;Parenting Educational Seminars and Workshops

*   Supporting our affiliate&nbsp;Parent Support Groups (Parent Volunteers, Hockey PSG,&nbsp;Rugby PSG) and our&nbsp;Sport&nbsp;Clubs, namely the Athletics Club and Saints&nbsp;FC (Soccer) in their&nbsp;respective&nbsp;school&nbsp;programmes  
    
*   Organising&nbsp;fund-raising&nbsp;events (Annual Food &amp; Fun&nbsp;Fairs, Saints Golf Challenge, Wine&nbsp;Dinners) to finance our various workshops, student&nbsp;initiatives,&nbsp;and school&nbsp;programmes  
    

We&nbsp;endeavour&nbsp;to support&nbsp;the school,&nbsp;through our awareness campaigns, newsletters and direct engagements&nbsp;to encourage more&nbsp;parents to join the association to carry on the baton to support our sons during their&nbsp;journey through&nbsp;St Andrew's.&nbsp;Whatever support, time, effort or financial&nbsp;assistance is volunteered, your kindness will touch many&nbsp;in our Saints&nbsp;community&nbsp;- ONE FAMILY UNBROKEN.
