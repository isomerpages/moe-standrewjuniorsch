SAPTA Cares, launched in 2013 is a fund dedicated to support our most needy FAS (Financial Assistance Scheme) boys and their families. Funded by Donors, a portion of the profits from our annual SAPTA Carnival and Membership Subscriptions, it has enabled SAPTA to reach out and touch the lives of many Saints students in both SAJS and SASS.

  

One of the main beneficiaries of the fund is St Andrew's Junior School's Extend-A-Care Program. The Extend-A-Care (EAC) Program extends a hand to boys who are in need of after school care due to their family circumstances
