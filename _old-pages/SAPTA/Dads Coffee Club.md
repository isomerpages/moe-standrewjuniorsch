<p>Magic happens when a son gets the undivided attention of his father.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
boy has a role model in his father. He is secure. He knows who he can turn
to when he needs help.</p>
<p>At Saints Dads’ Coffee Club, we have sharing sessions and events that
encourage one-to-one father son bonding.</p>
<p>We have activities every month, interactive talks by guest speakers and
Father-Son bonding activities.</p>
<p>Our guest speakers are from different walks of life, from school principals
to prison officers, all who share the firm belief that the world will be
a better place when fathers are present in their children’s lives.</p>

<p>Saints DCC monthly talks are reserved for fathers only. We believe in
providing a safe environment for Saints fathers to share our fathering
challenges. It is within this safe space that we commit ourselves to&nbsp;take
action&nbsp;on the areas of fathering that need attention.</p>
