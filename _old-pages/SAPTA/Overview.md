<p>The St. Andrew’s Parent-Teacher Association (SAPTA) was founded several
decades ago with well-meaning parents coming together to support the school
by getting involved with its activities. The association was officially
registered in 1970 as a voluntary&nbsp;organisation&nbsp;that works to
support the well-being of parents, teachers, and students.</p>
<p>The SAPTA logo integrates the letter “A” with three triangles at the end
of the masthead representing&nbsp;PARENTS,&nbsp;TEACHERS&nbsp;and&nbsp;STUDENTS,
our&nbsp;main focus. In supporting the school, SAPTA members come together
to provide for the needs of all our parents, teachers, and boys. Areas
where we focus our efforts are:</p>
