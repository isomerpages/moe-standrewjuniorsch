<p>SAPTA Cares, launched in 2013 is a fund dedicated to support our most
needy FAS (Financial Assistance Scheme) boys and their families. Funded
by Donors, a portion of the profits from our annual SAPTA Carnival and
Membership Subscriptions, it has enabled SAPTA to reach out and touch the
lives of many Saints students in both SAS(J) and SAS(S).</p>
<p>One of the main beneficiaries of the fund is St Andrewâ€™s School(Junior)'s
Extend-A-Care Program. The Extend-A-Care (EAC) Program extends a hand to
boys who&nbsp;are in need of&nbsp;after school care due to their family
circumstances.</p>
