<p>Saints&nbsp;Mums&nbsp;Club (SMC) was previous known as&nbsp;Mumsâ€™&nbsp;Book
club, founded by Ex-SASS principal,&nbsp;Mrs&nbsp;Lucy&nbsp;Toh. As the
landscape of parenting evolved, SAPTA&nbsp;recognised&nbsp;the need to
reach out and engage parents in a different way.</p>
<p>The vision of Ex-SAPTA Chairlady,&nbsp;Mrs&nbsp;Deborah Wang-Lee is to
Empower, Engage and Encourage parents,to&nbsp;build a supportive community
in SAV.&nbsp;With this in mind,&nbsp;Mrs&nbsp;Deborah Wang-Lee successfully
reformed&nbsp;Mum's&nbsp;Book Club to Saints&nbsp;Mums&nbsp;Club.</p>
<p>Since 2018, SMC has been conducting monthly sharing and parenting talks
that help&nbsp;mums&nbsp;to journey through the rough terrain of parenting
teenage boys. In 2020, due to Covid-19 pandemic, SMC team shifted from&nbsp;organising&nbsp;talks
in school to&nbsp;organising and hosting parenting Webinars via Zoom, and
with this move the team saw an increase in the number of mothers we managed
to reach out to. This has encouraged the team tremendously, and we hope
to see more mothers joining us.</p>
<p>As SMC team believes in a holistic approach in parenting, other than talks
on parenting skills, we also&nbsp;organised&nbsp;talks on healthy eating
and Education &amp; Career Guidance.</p>
